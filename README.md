# Alarm Lamp

Here is the code for a alarm lamp. It uses an ATMEGA328-P along with
a TM1637 four digit display, a DS1307 real time clock to keep time, 
and a LED strip salvaged from a TV's backlight.

With these it keeps time and turns the LED strip on at a set time
every day. The idea is that this should wake me up. In reality it
doesn't do much more than motivate me to get out of be when I do
wake up.
